# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using MySQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

```sql

use amazon_db;

CREATE TABLE category (
category_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
category_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE sellers (
seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
seller_name VARCHAR(25),
origin VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(25),
last_name VARCHAR(25),
state VARCHAR(25)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(50),
price FLOAT,
cogs FLOAT,
category_id INT,
CONSTRAINT products_ref_category FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory (
inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_id INT,
stock INT,
warehouse_id INT,
last_stock_date date,
CONSTRAINT inventory_ref_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_date date,
customer_id INT,
seller_id INT,
order_status VARCHAR(15),
CONSTRAINT orders_ref_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
CONSTRAINT orders_ref_sellers FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_id INT,
product_id INT,
quantity INT,
price_per_unit FLOAT,
CONSTRAINT orderitems_ref_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id),
CONSTRAINT orderitems_ref_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE payments (
payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_id INT,
payment_date DATE,
payment_status VARCHAR(20),
CONSTRAINT payments_ref_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE shipping (
shipping_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_id INT,
shipping_date DATE,
return_date DATE,
shipping_providers VARCHAR(25),
delivery_status VARCHAR(25),
CONSTRAINT shipping_ref_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (order_id)
);
```

---

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

---

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:
1. Top Selling Products
Query the top 10 products by total sales value.
Challenge: Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.

```sql
WITH t AS (
    SELECT o.product_id, p.product_name, 
        SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold, 
        ROUND(SUM(o.quantity * o.price_per_unit), 2) AS total_sales_value
    FROM order_items o
    LEFT JOIN products p 
        ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY o.product_id, p.product_name
)
SELECT product_name, total_quantity_sold, total_sales_value
FROM t
ORDER BY total_sales_value DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

2. Revenue by Category
Calculate total revenue generated by each product category.
Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

```sql
WITH t AS (
    SELECT p.category_id, c.category_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(o.quantity * o.price_per_unit), 2) AS revenue
    FROM order_items o
    LEFT JOIN products p 
        ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    LEFT JOIN category c 
        ON p.category_id = c.category_id
    GROUP BY p.category_id, c.category_name
)
SELECT *, 
	ROUND(revenue / (SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM t) * 100, 2) AS percent_contribution
FROM t;
```

3. Average Order Value (AOV)
Compute the average order value for each customer.
Challenge: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.

```sql

        ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit), 2) AS total_value
    FROM order_items oi
    LEFT JOIN orders o 
        ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    LEFT JOIN customers c 
        ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, 
    ROUND((total_value / orders), 2) AS aov
FROM t
WHERE orders > 5;
```

4. Monthly Sales Trend

    SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, 
        (oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS price, 
        DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y/%m') AS month
    FROM orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi 
        ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
),
t2 AS (
    SELECT month, 
        ROUND(SUM(price), 2) AS total_sales
    FROM t
    WHERE order_date > (SELECT SUBDATE(MAX(order_date), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) FROM orders)

    o.order_id IS NULL;

/*time since registration is not possible as data does not have customer registration date, but if
the data is available (column "reg_date"), then the code can be written as - */

SELECT 
    customer_id, first_name, last_name, state,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), reg_date) AS days_since_registration

Create a stored procedure that, when a product is sold, performs the following actions:
Inserts a new sales record into the orders and order_items tables.
Updates the inventory table to reduce the stock based on the product and quantity purchased.
The procedure should ensure that the stock is adjusted immediately after recording the sale.

```SQL
drop procedure if exists add_sales;
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE add_sales (
    IN p_order_id INT,
    IN p_customer_id INT,
    IN p_seller_id INT,
    IN p_order_item_id INT,
    IN p_product_id INT,
    IN p_quantity INT
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_count INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE v_price FLOAT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE v_product VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT '';

    -- Fetch product name and price
    SELECT price, product_name
    INTO v_price, v_product
    FROM products
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id;

    -- Check inventory availability
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count
    FROM inventory
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id
    AND stock >= p_quantity;

    IF v_count > 0 THEN
        -- Insert into orders
        INSERT INTO orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id)
        VALUES (p_order_id, CURRENT_DATE(), p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

        -- Insert into order_items without total_sale
        INSERT INTO order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit)
        VALUES (p_order_item_id, p_order_id, p_product_id, p_quantity, v_price);

        -- Update inventory stock
        UPDATE inventory
        SET stock = stock - p_quantity
        WHERE product_id = p_product_id;

        SELECT CONCAT('Thank you! Product: ', v_product, ' sale has been added, and inventory stock updated.') AS Message;
    ELSE
        SELECT CONCAT('Thank you! The product: ', v_product, ' is not available.') AS Message;
    END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```
